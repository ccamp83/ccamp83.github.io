### **Endpoints**

Distribution of the endpoints averaged across all subjects. Data is split across relative depth (40 and 50 mm).

Filled circles: middle position during vertical grasp. Triangles, diamonds and open circles: thumb, index and middle positions during horizontal grasp.\n

```{r echo=F, message=F, fig.align='center'}
setwd("/home/carlo/github/ccamp83.github.io/multiple_maps/")
source("./visuospatial_compression_analysis.r")
print(output)
```

Comparison between difference between endpoints of the vertical grasp (red) and FGA of the horizontal grasp (green).

```{r echo=F, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
print(output.diff)
```
