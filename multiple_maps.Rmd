### **Endpoints**

Distribution of the endpoints averaged across all subjects. Data is split across relative depth (40 and 50 mm).

Filled circles: middle position during vertical grasp. Triangles, diamonds and open circles: thumb, index and middle positions during horizontal grasp.\n

```{r echo=F, message=F}
setwd("/home/carlo/github/ccamp83.github.io/multiple_maps/")
source("./visuospatial_compression_analysis.r")
print(output)
```

In order to quantify the visuospatial compression, we calculated the average difference between the endpoints.

There were a total of 12 differences: for the small depth (40mm) ...

```{r echo=F}
print(output.diff)
```
